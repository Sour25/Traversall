Instructions
Traversal of Graph using DFS and BFS
In this assignment, you will be implementing Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms to perform traversal on the graph provided in Exercise 2.

Understanding DFS and BFS
Before you begin, it's important to understand the concepts of DFS and BFS.

DFS (Depth-First Search): DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

BFS (Breadth-First Search): BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph) and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

Implementing DFS and BFS
DFS Implementation: You will need to write a function or method to perform DFS traversal on the given graph. Make sure to understand the recursive nature of DFS and how it explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

BFS Implementation: Similarly, you will need to write a function or method to perform BFS traversal on the given graph. Understand how BFS explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

Creating a Repository with README
After implementing DFS and BFS, create a repository on a version control platform such as GitHub. In the repository, include a README file that explains your results. The README should include:

A brief overview of the graph used for traversal
Explanation of the DFS traversal process and the results obtained
Explanation of the BFS traversal process and the results obtained
Any observations or insights gained from the traversal process
Submission
Once you have completed the implementations and created the repository with the README, submit the link to your repository for evaluation.

Remember to take your time to understand the concepts of DFS and BFS before implementing them.



Good luck!
